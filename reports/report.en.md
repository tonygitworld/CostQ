## Step 2: Intelligent Anomaly Detection and Root Cause Analysis

### 2.1 Anomaly Detection Results

Detected Cost Spike:

* **Date:** August 1, 2025
* **Anomaly Cost:** \$7,708.45 (+92.5% vs. daily average)
* **Daily Average Baseline:** \$4,003.46
* **Standard Deviation:** \$1,852.39

### 2.2 Anomaly Cost Assessment

Analysis of August 1 Anomaly:

* **Key Service:** EC2 Compute (\$3,391.78)
* **ChargeType:** Primarily regular Usage charges, not cyclical costs
* **Assessment:** A genuine anomaly requiring deeper investigation

### 2.3 Root Cause Analysis

Due to CloudTrail data access restrictions, deep API-level investigation was not possible. Recommended actions:

1. Enable **organization-level CloudTrail** for future anomaly analysis
2. Verify whether large-scale instance launches or configuration changes occurred on Aug 1
3. Review **auto-scaling policies** and scheduled tasks
