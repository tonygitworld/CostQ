• Jumped from $2.10 baseline to $3.58 peak  

### 2.2 Anomaly Cost Determination

ChargeType Analysis  
• All costs were "Usage" type, not recurring fees  
• **Confirmed real anomalies, requires deep analysis**  

### 2.3 Root Cause Analysis

Anomaly Window Analysis (Aug 28–31)  

Key Drivers  
1. EC2 - Compute: from $0.77 to $1.39 (+81%)  
   • New instance launched or instance type upgraded  
2. VPC Cost: from $0.32 to $0.36 (+13%)  
   • Increased NAT Gateway data processing  
3. AWS Config: abnormal increase of $0.18  
   • Surge in configuration change evaluations  

CloudTrail Analysis Limitation  
• No CloudTrail access provided, unable to perform API-level root cause analysis  
• Recommend enabling org-level CloudTrail for future anomaly investigations
